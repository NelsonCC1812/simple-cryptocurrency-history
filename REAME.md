# Crypto currency historical app

This small app takes crypto coins from an external API and let you choose between then.

* You can choose a start and a final date (from - to) to select the period.
* The styles and grid have been made in Boostrap (and is only for an small University project) so not very stetically worked.

> Due to high volume of coins and data, the App can be very slow specially at the beginning.
